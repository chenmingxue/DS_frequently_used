## Data science 24 projects 
### Easy:
1. IRIS, classification (3)\
This is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful dataset in pattern recognition literature. Nothing could be simpler than the Iris dataset to learn classification techniques. If you are totally new to data science, this is your start line. The data has only 150 rows & 4 columns.

2. Loan Prediction, classification (2) #nice explanation to common ML algos\
Among all industries, the insurance domain has one of the largest uses of analytics & data science methods. This dataset provides you a taste of working on data sets from insurance companies – what challenges are faced there, what strategies are used, which variables influence the outcome, etc. This is a classification problem. The data has 615 rows and 13 columns.

3. Big Market Sales prediction, linear regression\
Retail is another industry which extensively uses analytics to optimize business processes. Tasks like product placement, inventory management, customized offers, product bundling, etc. are being smartly handled using data science techniques. As the name suggests, this data comprises of transaction records of a sales store. This is a regression problem. The data has 8523 rows of 12 variables.

4. Boston house price prediction, data load from jupyter\
This is another popular dataset used in pattern recognition literature. The data set comes from the real estate industry in Boston (US). This is a regression problem. The data has 506 rows and 14 columns. Thus, it’s a fairly small data set where you can attempt any technique without worrying about your laptop’s memory being overused.

5. Time Series Analysis, (static statistics) #nice practice of statistical data analysis of stocks (time series)\
Time Series is one of the most commonly used techniques in data science. It has wide ranging applications – weather forecasting, predicting sales, analyzing year on year trends, etc. This dataset is specific to time series and the challenge here is to forecast traffic on a mode of transportation. The data has ** rows and ** columns.
This dataset analysis requires more knowledges of statistics for finance.

6. Wine quality analysis and prediction #nice visualization \
This is one of the most popular datasets along data science beginners. It is divided into 2 datasets. You can perform both regression and classification tasks on this data. It will test your understanding in different fields – outlier detection, feature selection, and unbalanced data. There are 4898 rows and 12 columns in this dataset.

7. Turkiye Student Evaluation, #data visualization and clustering\
This dataset is based on an evaluation form filled out by students for different courses. It has different attributes including attendance, difficulty, score for each evaluation question, among others. This is an unsupervised learning problem. The dataset has 5820 rows and 33 columns.

8. Height and weight analysis #data visualization\
This is a fairly straightforward problem and is ideal for people starting off with data science. It is a regression problem.  The dataset has 25,000 rows and 3 columns (index, height and weight).

### Medium:
9. Black Friday Sales Dataset\
This dataset comprises of sales transactions captured at a retail store. It’s a classic dataset to explore and expand your feature engineering skills and day to day understanding from multiple shopping experiences. This is a regression problem. The dataset has 550,069 rows and 12 columns.

10. Human Activity Recognition Dataset, data group, visualization and LSTM Deeplearning\
This data set is collected from recordings of 30 human subjects captured via smartphones enabled with embedded inertial sensors.This is a multi-classification problem. The data set has 10,299 rows and 561 columns.

11. Text Mining Dataset. Multi-label classification.\
This dataset text mining and multi-lable classification practice from Kaggle.

12. Bike rental prediction on trip history dataset. Data analysis, visualization, encoding on categorical data, regression \
This dataset comes from a bike sharing service in the United States. This dataset requires you to exercise your pro data munging skills. The data is provided quarter-wise from 2010 (Q4) onwards. Each file has 7 columns. It is a classification problem.

13. Million Song Dataset, Predict release year of the song.\
Did you know data science can be used in the entertainment industry also? Do it yourself now. This data set puts forward a regression task. It consists of 5,15,345 observations and 90 variables. However, this is just a tiny subset of the original database of data about a million songs.

14. Census Income Dataset, imbalanced dataset\
It’s an imbalanced classification and a classic machine learning problem. You know, machine learning is being extensively used to solve imbalanced problems such as cancer detection, fraud detection etc. It’s time to get your hands dirty. The data set has 48,842 rows and 14 columns.

15. Movie Lens Dataset, similarity of data point\
Have you built a recommendation system yet? Here’s your chance! This dataset is one of the most popular & quoted datasets in the data science industry. It is available in various dimensions. Here I’ve used a fairly small size. It has 1 million ratings from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies.
